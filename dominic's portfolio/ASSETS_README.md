Assets naming & placement

- Place website images in `assets-images/` at the `dominic's portfolio` folder level.
- Use lowercase and hyphens for filenames (e.g., `my-photo.jpg`). Avoid spaces and special characters.
- Reference images from HTML in `source/html/` using relative paths: `../../assets-images/my-photo.jpg`.
- If you add many large images, consider using Git LFS and add its configuration.
